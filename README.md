# **WIP**

# KA
My own C memory allocation library.

Working:\
Basic vectors and strings (plus some string manipulation: copy, concatanate, slice) - fully working and memory safe hopefully

Will implement better pointers, n-dimensional vectors

# KAE
An extension for this library that implements stack, queue and linked-list
